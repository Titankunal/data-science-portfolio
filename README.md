## 🎯 Project Overview

**Problem:** Public transport delays are unpredictable and cost commuters time and productivity.

**Solution:** A machine learning system that predicts whether a trip will be delayed based on real-time conditions including weather, events, congestion, and time of day.

**Impact:** Helps commuters plan smarter and demonstrates end-to-end data science skills across data engineering, modeling, and full-stack deployment.
